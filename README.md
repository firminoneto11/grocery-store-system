## 🏢 Business rules 🏢

- [x] When a sale is made on the sale screen, the product's table has to be updated in the 'amount_in_stock' field according to the amount of the products that were sold.
- [x] If a product's amount in stock is equal or less than 0 it can not be sold.
- [x] When a sale is made, the invoice table must be updated with the gross total, net total and tax total each product sold. Each product has it's own taxes so the system should be able to see these taxes and calculate accordingly.
- [x] If a product is not active, it can not be sold.
- [x] On the sales table, the customer's name and customer's cpf are optional, because not everyone wants to share this information.
